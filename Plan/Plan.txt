INTERSHIT TEAM UNITED co.

This is the plan:

#1 (the only goal) break all the rules of the game jam.

### Overview ###

Main character : Miss Inter Pretation
Main boss : Chris
Levels : Inter Acts (If you don't collide with certain objects you can't get
          to next "act" or level [double meaning on the interact])
Tasks : Inter Missions - breaks in play where you have to complete
        meaningless things.
Transport: Inter nShip - where you do nothing and wastes time
Currency: Interchange

### Specifics ###

Controls: Arrow keys = move: left/right, up: jump, down: crouch.
          Spacebar = attack.
          Q = Switch weapon.
          W = Block (only good for certain attacks)
          E = Interact (if possible)
          R = Magic (changes an incoming attack into a heal, time based)

Upgrades: Costs interchange to increase health, damage, reduce time on R etc.

High score: using time to complete game?
