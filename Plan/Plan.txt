INTERSHIT TEAM UNITED co.

This is the plan:

#1 (the only goal) break all the rules of the game jam.

### Overview ###

Main character : Miss Inter Pretation
Main boss : Chris
Levels : Inter Acts (If you don't collide with certain objects you can't get
          to next "act" or level [double meaning on the interact])
Tasks : Inter Missions - breaks in play where you have to complete
        meaningless things.
Transport: Inter nShip - where you do nothing and wastes time
Currency: Interchange
Level boss: Interrogate final boss at each level to reach Chris.

### Specifics ###

Controls: Arrow keys = move: left/right, up: jump, down: crouch.
          Spacebar = attack.
          Q = Switch weapon.
          W = Block (only good for certain attacks)
          E = Interact (if possible) (?!? Interrobang)
          R = Magic (changes an incoming attack into a heal, time based)

Upgrades: Costs interchange to increase health, damage, reduce time on R etc.

High score: using time to complete game?





Voice lines for Hugh:

1)
"This is a story of a girl named Inter. Inter worked for a company in a big building where she was employee number 7 2 4. Employee number 7 2 4's job was simple.
She sat at her desk in room 7 2 4, and she pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to her through a monitor on her desk telling her which buttons to push,
how long to push them, and in what order. This is what employee 7 2 4 did every every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending,
Inter relished every moment that the orders came in as though she had been made exactly for this job. And Inter, was happy.
And then one day something very perculiar happened. Something that would forever change Inter. Something she would never quite forget. She had been making her game for nearly an hour
when she realised that not one single reasonable theme idea had arrived on the monitor for her to follow. No one had showed up to challenge the jam master,
call for a vote, or even complain. Never, in all her years of game jams, had this happened. This complete change. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozon solid,
Inter found herself unable to move for the longest time. But as she came to her witts and regained her senses, she got up from her desk and stepped out of her office.
Everything had become Crys-tal clear"
